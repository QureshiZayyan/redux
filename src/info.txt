            slices = initial state, reducer (functions to update state )
                                          |
 export the reducer functions to use in components and export to add in store
                                          |
                  add the reducers in the store using the slice name
                                          |
 import the reducer function in the component, if u want a component read the state use useSelector to read the state 
for component and use useDisptach for updating the state


Yes, thatâ€™s correct! ðŸŽ¯ You've understood the flow well. Here's a quick confirmation:

Slices contain:

initialState (the starting state)

reducers (functions to update the state)

Exporting the reducer functions to use in components and to be added to the store.

In the store, you add the reducers using the slice name.

In the component, use:

useSelector to read the state.

useDispatch to update the state by dispatching actions.

Great job! Let me know if you need more help or a deeper ex
